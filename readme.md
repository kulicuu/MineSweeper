###### play
Play this implementation online at:
[minesweeper-svg.herokuapp.com](https://minesweeper-svg.herokuapp.com/)

###### develop
To build, develop, and play locally:

- clone, `npm install`, `npm install -g coffee-script`, `npm install -g webpack`
- `webpack -w`
- `coffee server.coffee`
- open browser at `localhost:3000`
- open text editor and hack away.  (You'll need to refresh the page manually to get fresh batch from webpack; I find this superior to having the page reload itself everytime I save a file).

###### ttd:
- win game sequence
- timer time elapsed
- performance tuning
- better graphic-design,
