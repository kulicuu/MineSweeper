###### play
Play this implementation online at:

[minesweeper-svg.herokuapp.com](minesweeper-svg.herokuapp.com)

###### develop
To build, develop, and play locally:

- clone, npm install,
- `webpack -w`
- `coffee server.coffee`, you maybe need to install `npm install -g coffee-script` globally first.
- open browser at `localhost:3000`
- open text editor and hack away.  (You'll need to refresh the page manually to get fresh batch from webpack; I find this superior to having the page reload itself everytime I save a file).

###### ttd:
- timer time elapsed
- performance tuning
- better graphics,
